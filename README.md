# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project consists in analyzing PyBer ride-share data using pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide PyBer insight on Drivers, Rides and Fares by City Type.

## Results
After analyzing the data from PyBer as shown on the table below, we can conclude the following for each city type:

### Urban
Urban cities have the highest number of Drivers, Rides, and Total Fares. The Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver are the lowest when compared to Suburban and Rural cities.

### Rural
Rural cities have the lowest number of Drivers, Rides and Total Fares. The Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver is the highest when compared with Urban and Suburban cities.

### Suburban
Suburban cities are right in between Urban and Rural on all parameters analyzed.

### Urban, Rural and Suburban
When analyzing all 3 types of cities over a period of 4 months, we can observe that the Total Fare peak was on the end of February and there's a lot of oscillation throughout March.

## Summary
The size of the city is directly proportional to the Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares, while indirectly proportional to Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. With that said, the company can look into limiting the amount of drivers in urban cities and increasing the amount of drivers in rural areas to achieve profit goals.
Another suggestion is to further analyze why there's a spike on Suburban Total Fares in April, while in Urban and Rural cities are trending
